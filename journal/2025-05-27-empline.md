# Hack Log 4 - TryHackMe [Empline](https://tryhackme.com/room/empline)

📅 **Date:** 2025-05-27  
🔍 **Objective:** Obtain user and root flag.  
🎯 **Target:** TryHackMe Empline (Lab CTF)

---

## 🛠️ Actions Taken  

- **Port & Service Enumeration**  
  ```
  nmap -sV <IP>
  ```
   → Found SSH and HTTP runnning on port 22 and 80 respectively.  
   

- **Virtual Host Discovery**  
  → While analyzing the page source found a reference to virtual host. **http://job.empline.thm/**  
  → Added an entry in `/etc/hosts` for the virtual host.    
  → Found a login page for **opencats** which is an open source ATS.  
  → The version of the opencats was **0.9.4**.  
  → Searched the web and found that this particular version is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.  
  

- **Exploitation**  
  → Opencats 0.9.4 fails to properly validate file upload which leads to remote code execution.  
  → Used the exploit script to gain a shell.  
  → Acquired shell was unstable therefore uploaded a robust php reverse shell to the target machine.  
  → Acquired a stable reverse shell.  

- **Post Exploitation**  
  → Upon searching found `config.php` file in **/var/www/opencats** directory.  
  → This file contains database credentials.  
  → Logged in to the database via the credentials.  
  → Found a table named **users** containing usernames and password hashes.  
  → Found password hash for the user **george**.  
  → Used [crackstation](https://crackstation.net) to successfully crack the password hash.  
  →  Succesfully changed user to **george** and obtained the user flag from home directory.  

- **Privilege Escalation**  
  → Ran linpeas script to find possible privilege escalation vectors.  
  → Discovered that the **ruby** binary has the capability set to **cap_chown+ep**.  
  → Changed the ownership of /etc/shadow file to user **george**.  
    ```
    ruby -w 'File.chown(1002, 1002, "/etc/shadow")'  
    ```
  → Changing the root user's password  
    - Creating the new password hash.
      ```
      openssl passwd -6 'newpassword'
      ```
     - Replaced the hash of the root user's password with this newly generated hash.  
 
  → Succesfully switched user to root by using the new password and obtained root flag.  

## 🔍 Key Findings      

- **Opencats 0.9.4** vulnerable to remote code execution.  
- Ruby binary with **cap_chown+ep** capability.  

## 📚 What I Learned   

- Linux capabilities are fine-grained permissions.    
- Capabilities allows programs to perform specific privileged operations without needing full root access.  
- Improper file validation can be a serious risk, malicious files can be uploaded and used to achieve RCE.
