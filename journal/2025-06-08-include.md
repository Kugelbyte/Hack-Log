🔍 **Objective:** Obtain first flag from Sysmon Portal and second flag from /var/www/html directory.  
🎯 **Target:** TryHackMe Include (Lab CTF)

## 🛠️ Actions Taken

- **Port and Service Enumeration**  
```
nmap -sS -sV --script=http-enum 10.10.3.246
```

| Port    | Service  | Description                    |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------|
| 25/ | smtp     | Postfix smtpd                  |
| 110 | pop3     | Dovecot pop3d                  |
| 143 | imap     | Dovecot imapd (Ubuntu)         |
| 993 | ssl/imap | Dovecot imapd (Ubuntu)         |
| 995 | ssl/pop3 | Dovecot pop3d                  |
| 4000| http     | Node.js (Express middleware)   |
| 50000| http    | Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu)) |  


→ The "http-enum" script revealed "/login.php", "/templates", "/uploads" directories.  
→ Visiting http://10.10.3.246:50000/login.php revealed a portal called Sysmon.  
→ Visiting http://10.10.3.146:4000 revealed a Review App with the credentials to login into the app.    
          

- **Escalating privilege to Admin in Review Application**  

→ After logging into the app, opened the My Profile section.  
→ Profile section consisted of information displayed in key:value pair format and two input fields for submitting similar data.  
→ Found one key:value pair as **isAdmin:false**.  
→ Entered a new pair via the input fields as **isAdmin:true**.  
→ The action resulted in gaining admin access to the Review App.  
→ Two additional sections were added in the top menu bar of the Review App, named as API and Settings.  
→ Visiting API section revealed two internal api endpoints with their descriptions.  
  ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/internal-api
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/getAllAdmins101099991
  ```   
→ Description of the second endpoint pointed that it returns credentials in response.  

- **Discovering SSRF**

→ The Settings section revealed a functionality to update the Banner image.    
→ URL Input was present which took the URL of the image.     
→ Entered the address found in the API section into the URL input field and received a base64 encoded response.  
→ Decoding the response revealed the credentials for Sysmon portal.  
→ Logged into the portal and obtained the first flag.  

- **Local File Inclusion**

→ Upon observing the page source of the portal, found an interesting endpoint as **profile.php?img=**.    
→ Started fuzzing the endpoint for LFI via Burp Suite using a wordlist.  
→ After some time found result for /etc/passwd, which confirmed LFI.  

- **SMTP Log Poisoning**  
→ Started finding logs in /var/log for log poisoning.    
→ After some attempts found log entries in /var/log/mail.log.  
→ Injecting php payload.  
   - Since the target already had SMTP running on 25, accessed the service via netcat.  
   - Injected the payload in the "RCPT TO" option as:  
     ```
     HELO 10.10.3.246  
     MAIL FROM:<dummy@mail.com>  
     RCPT TO:<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>  
     ```
→ After injecting the checked the mail.log file and found an error logged stating **Illegal Address syntax** in "RCPT TO".  
→ This confirmed that poisoning was successfull since php was injected in "RCPT TO" which normally accepts email adresses.  

- **Exploitation**  
→ Crafted a new request with the endpoint as **profile.php?img=<LFI payload>mail.log&cmd=pwd**.  
→ After sending the request checked the entries in mail.log and found that there was an entry as "/var/www/html".  
→ Remote Code Execution via Log poisoning was successfull.  
→ Sent another request as **profile.php?img=<LFI payload>mail.log&cmd=ls%20-la** and found the hidden flag file.  
→ Obtained the flag via another request as  **profile.php?img=<LFI payload>mail.log&cmd=cat%20<filename>**.  


## 🔍 Key Findings  

- Mass Assignment vulnerability which gave admin access to Review App.  
- Local API endpoints to access credentials.  
- Server Side Request Forgery in Banner Image updation functionality.  
- Local File Inclusion in "profile.php?img=" endpoint.  
- Remote Code Execution via Log Poisoning.  

## 📚 What I Learned  

- Fuzzing can take time, filtering the results can help greatly.  
- Poisoning the logs to gain RCE.
