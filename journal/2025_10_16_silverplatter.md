‚Üí Nothing interesting.  
‚Üí Enumerating http-proxy served on port 8080.

```
‚Üí Visiting the "console" and "website" resulted in just page not found error.  

### üîê Authentication Bypass  
‚Üí Upon exploring the website on port 80, found a message on Contacts page.  
```html
If you'd like to get in touch with us, please reach out to our project manager on Silverpeas. His username is "scr1ptkiddy".
```
‚Üí The message mentions "Silverpeas" and a username "scr1ptkiddy".  
‚Üí Silverpeas is an open-source software for collaboration in a company environment.  
‚Üí Silverpeas was running on port 8080 at "http://10.201.74.112:8080/silverpeas". Visiting the address gave a Login Page.  
‚Üí Upon researching about vulnerabilities in Silverpeas, found an authentication bypass vulnearbility in silverpeas.  
‚Üí This vulnerability allows unauthenticated access by omitting the "password" field from the Login request to AuthenticationServlet.     
‚Üí Intercepting the login request on Burp.  
  ```html
POST /silverpeas/AuthenticationServlet HTTP/1.1

```
‚Üí Modifying the request by completely omitting the Password field.  

```html

```

‚Üí Forwarding the intercepted request resulted in succesfull login as user "scr1ptkiddy".  
‚Üí Upon exploring the Silverpeas portal, found 2 more users 
- Manager
- Administrateur  

‚Üí Attempted to login as Administrateur using the same bypass technique but it didn't worked.  
‚Üí Succesfully logged in as "Manager" via the same bypass technique.  
‚Üí The inbox of the user "Manager" on Silverpeas portal had a message  
```bash
Dude how do you always forget the SSH password? Use a password manager and quit using your silly sticky notes. 

Username: tim

Password: cm0nt!md0ntf0rg3tth!spa$$w0rdagainlol
```
‚Üí Found the SSH credentials.  

### üíª SSH Login  

‚Üí Using the found credentials, succesfully logged in via ssh as user "tim".  
‚Üí Found the first flag in "user.txt" in "/home/tim" directory.  

### ü™ú Privilege Escalation  

‚Üí There were no binaries with SUID bits.  
‚Üí Using "sudo -l" didn't worked.  
‚Üí Upon exploring the "/var/log" directory, there was the log file "auth.log.2" in which there was this entry
  ```html
tyler : TTY=tty1 ; PWD=/ ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/docker run --name postgresql -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=_Zd_zx7N823/ -v postgresql-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:12.3
```
‚Üí There is an another user named "tyler" and there is the password for POSTGRES.  
‚Üí Tried running the postgres image but the user "tim" was not permitted to run docker.  
‚Üí Exploring further in the same directory found a directory named "installer". This directory contained more logs.  
‚Üí The "autoinstall-user-data" file in the "installer" directory had the below entry  
```html
identity:
    hostname: silver-platter
    password: $6$uJuA1kpnd4kTFniw$/402iWwKzcYD8AMHG6bY/PXwZWOkrrVmtoO7qQpfvVLh1CHmiKUodwMGP7/awDYtrzpDHV8cNbpS1HJ6VMakN.
    realname: root
    username: tyler
```  
‚Üí This revealed the password hash for user tyler and it also worth noting that tyler is also root.  
‚Üí The password hash was SHA512 and was salted which rendered cracking the hash not feasible.  
‚Üí Reusing the previously found Postgres password for user tyler gave access as user tyler.  
‚Üí Since the user "tyler" is also root, therefore succesfully obtained the root flag from "/root/root.txt".  


## üîç Key Findings  

‚Üí Authentication Bypass vulnerability in Silverpeas proved useful in gaining intital access.  
‚Üí Lack of unique password resulted in privilege escalation to root. 

## üìö What I Learned ?
‚Üí Bruteforce should be the last resort, it is always recommended to enumerate more and more.  
‚Üí Reusing passwords can be the worst mistake made by system admins.
