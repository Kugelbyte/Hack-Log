# 🧠 Hacking Journal

This is my personal logbook where I document what I explore, break, and learn in the world of hacking and cybersecurity.

> I publish full writeups separately on [my Medium profile](https://medium.com/@yourusername)

## 📓 How I Use This Journal

- Each `.md` file in `/journal` is a raw hacking session or lab note
- These are **unfiltered**, **technical**, and **chronological**
- Full polished articles go to Medium once the experiment is complete

## 🗂️ Entries

Check the [`/journal`](./journal) folder for technical logs and notes.
